        <p>A Breathe of Innocence begins wit the quote “you always lose what you were never meant to have”(p.95) and <i>the mother </i>says “How was I not meant to keep her? She had been born into this world for me.” (P.95) The <small>child</small> was stolen, why does she believe it was born for her. The story also begins with a woman on a bed with blood between her legs, and her husband saying <b>“your a monster.”</b>The story ends with the same quote and also ends with the same story. Blood pooling around a <a href= "https://handmade-web.net">woman’s</a>legs. I thought at first read that the story at the beginning was the mother stealing the child from its family. But the ending is hr killing <span class="cool">her child.</span> Is it the same story or are things repeating themselves? In the middle of the story, it skips back again to when the mother steals the baby from the family that moved by her house. They steal from her garden and she says “you steal from me I steal from you.” (p.109) At the end when she stabs her daughter she says the same thing to the boy from the village.

            The mother watches women in the village from the shadows “I watched them take the fall for every mistake made, regardless of whether it was their fault or not.”(p.99) The mother was cursed for being a woman and everyone believing she is evil. She says about the women she sees; “you are all like me, there is no difference between us only they made me look how they see all of you. We’re no different.”(p.100) She keeps her daughter locked up because she can risk “corrupting her innocence.” It seems like she is protecting her daughter butte only stole the child to take it’s innocence. She says that her daughter’s unhappiness didn’t bother her because she was protecting her but she is protecting herself. When getting the child she says “it was possible that this child could save me from myself.” ( 
p.101) She tells herself she is doing this for the child but this was for her all along. Her happiness and security, not her daughter’s. </p>
