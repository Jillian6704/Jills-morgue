        <p1>When it comes to films, I like to watch a lot. In high school I started watching weird movies, B movies and any unusual movies I came across. I enjoy horror movies and comedies a lot. I don't really watch very many "serious" movies. I prefer horror movies with practical effects, like in the 80's, the best as that's what I try to do with my own art. I love comedies and watch them every day. My favorite genre has been horror-comedy for as long as I can remeber. </p1>
